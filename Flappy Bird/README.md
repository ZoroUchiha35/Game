# Gameplay Overview 
This Flappy Bird game captures the classic challenge with a clean, modern look.
- **Objective:** Control the bird to fly between green pipes without hitting them or the ground. Each pipe pair you pass increases your **score** by one.
- **Controls:** Tap or click the **Game canvas**, or press the **Spacebar**, to make the bird flap and gain altitude. The game starts on your first input.
- **Progressive Speed:** The game speed starts at 1.0x. It increases by 0.2x every 5 points you score `(reaching 1.2x at 5 points, 1.4x at 10, and so on).` The current multiplier is shown below the game area.
- **Expanded Play Area:** The game now runs on a 900x600 pixel canvas, providing a wider and taller view. The bird, pipes, and ground have been slightly scaled for better proportion.
